    <h3>About</h3>
    <p> "As a student front-end developer i want to look at affirmative web design quotes, so that imposter syndrome doesn't hit me hard."
        Is the userstory i chose to pursue for this project. 
        I myself have experienced imposter syndrome and if i can help a struggling student out with imposter syndrome, that would mean a lot to me.
